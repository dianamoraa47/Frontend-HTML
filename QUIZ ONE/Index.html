<p>You’re deep gold, and in you lay stories untold
Maps to ancient kingdoms and treasures of old
You’re unconquered country
And no flags bears you 
You’re deep gold and in you lays stories untold

You’re search for by the heavens and hunted by the abyss
You’re spoken off by eastern wings that whispers the impossible wish
The carry your scents to sailors; that search for you in minds and Oz
For you’re a deep gold and in you lies stories untold


My first paragraph.</p>

You’re deep gold, and in you lay stories untold
Maps to ancient kingdoms and treasures of old

You’re search for by the heavens and hunted by the abyss
You’re spoken off by eastern wings that whispers the impossible wish
The carry your scents to sailors; that search for you in minds and Oz
For you’re a deep gold and in you lies stories untold
